    <h2>The "Jungle Smoothie Supreme"</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Prep time:</strong> 2 awkward minutes of questioning your life choices.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 juicy mango (for tropical flair)</li>
      <li>2 slices of watermelon (for hydration and drama)</li>
      <li>1 freshly massaged antelope leg (for... protein?)</li>
      <li>A *dash* of giraffe’s piss (for that exotic tang nobody asked for)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Instructions:</strong><br />
      Toss everything into your blender. Close your eyes. Pretend you’re on a cooking show called
      <em> “Wild Bites: Nature’s Revenge.”</em>  
      Blend until you hear the distant roar of the savanna.  
      Pour into a glass, serve cold, and question your sanity while sipping.
